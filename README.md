# DeepLearning_FruitClassification

This project served as an introduction to deep learning by creating an image classification model using Keras library. Each team had to select an image dataset off of Kaggle, create a convolutional neural network for classification, and tune the network to obtain best results for the given dataset. 

There are two different models attached in this project: a simple model, as well as a more complex model. The simple model can be found in DL_Lab1.py, which uses the fruit_recognition.py to load the data. The more complex model is standalone and is found in cnn_fruit_recognition.py. 

DL-CNN-report.pdf provides more details regarding the experimentation and development of the models, as well as a link to the original dataset on Kaggle.
